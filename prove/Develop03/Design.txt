Encapsulation – Design Activity
Project: Scripture Memorizer

Purpose
This document outlines the design of the Scripture Memorizer program. This is a design-only activity focused on planning classes, responsibilities, and structure before implementation.

Discussion of Preparation Learning Activity

The most challenging part of the learning activity was understanding how encapsulation separates responsibilities between classes. Determining which class should handle specific logic required discussion, especially when deciding what data should be hidden versus exposed through methods. Once responsibilities were clearly defined, planning the class behaviors became more straightforward.

Program Specification Review

What does the program do?
The program helps users memorize scriptures by gradually hiding words from the scripture text while still displaying the reference.

User Inputs

* Press Enter to continue hiding words
* Type "quit" to end the program

Program Output

* Displays the scripture reference
* Displays the scripture text with some words hidden
* Updates the display each iteration

How does the program end?

* When the user types "quit"
* When all words in the scripture are hidden

---

Identified Classes and Responsibilities

Class: Scripture
Responsibility:

* Manages the scripture text and controls word hiding behavior

Class: Reference
Responsibility:

* Stores and formats scripture reference information

Class: Word
Responsibility:

* Represents a single word and tracks whether it is hidden

Class: ScriptureMemorizer (or Program)
Responsibility:

* Controls program flow and user interaction

---

Class Behaviors (Methods)

Scripture Class:

* Display(): Returns the scripture text with hidden words masked
* HideRandomWords(int count): Hides a specified number of visible words
* IsCompletelyHidden(): Returns true if all words are hidden

Reference Class:

* GetDisplayText(): Returns the formatted scripture reference

Word Class:

* Hide(): Marks the word as hidden
* IsHidden(): Returns whether the word is hidden
* GetDisplayText(): Returns the word text or a placeholder if hidden

ScriptureMemorizer Class:

* Run(): Executes the main program loop
* PromptUser(): Reads user input
* ClearScreen(): Clears the console display

---

Class Attributes

Scripture Class:

* Reference _reference
* List<Word> _words

Reference Class:

* string _book
* int _chapter
* int _startVerse
* int _endVerse

Word Class:

* string _text
* bool _isHidden

ScriptureMemorizer Class:

* Scripture _scripture

---

Constructors

Reference Class:

* Reference(string book, int chapter, int verse)
* Reference(string book, int chapter, int startVerse, int endVerse)

Word Class:

* Word(string text)

  * Initializes _isHidden to false

Scripture Class:

* Scripture(Reference reference, string text)

  * Splits the text into individual words
  * Creates Word objects
  * Stores words in a list

ScriptureMemorizer Class:

* ScriptureMemorizer()

  * Creates the Scripture instance
  * Initializes the program state

---

Conclusion

This design applies encapsulation by giving each class a single, well-defined responsibility. The structure allows the program to be easily modified or extended without impacting unrelated components. Adjustments to this design during implementation are expected and acceptable.
