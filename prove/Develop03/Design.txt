Encapsulation Design Document
Project: Scripture Memorizer

Purpose
This document describes the design of the Scripture Memorizer program. The program helps users memorize scripture by gradually hiding random words from the text until all words are hidden or the user chooses to quit.

Program Overview
The program displays a scripture reference and its corresponding scripture text. Each time the user presses Enter, three visible words are randomly selected and replaced with underscores. The process repeats until the user types "quit" or no visible words remain. At the end, the program displays the final version of the scripture and prints “Good job!”.

User Input

* Press Enter to hide additional words
* Type "quit" to exit the program

Program Output

* Displays the formatted scripture reference
* Displays the scripture text with some words replaced by underscores
* Displays a completion message when finished

Classes and Responsibilities

Program
Responsibility: Controls overall execution and user interaction.

* Creates Reference, Scripture, and ScriptureMemorizer objects
* Manages the main loop
* Clears the console and displays output
* Ends the program when conditions are met

Reference
Responsibility: Stores and formats scripture reference information.
Private Attributes:

* _book : string
* _chapter : string
* _verse : string
  Public Methods:
* Reference(string book, string chapter, string verse)
* toString() : string
  The toString() method returns the formatted reference in the form "Book Chapter:Verse".

Scripture
Responsibility: Stores scripture text and maintains its associated reference.
Private Attributes:

* _scriptureText : string
* _scriptureReference : Reference
  Public Methods:
* Scripture(Reference scriptureReference, string scriptureText)
* toString() : string
  The toString() method returns the full scripture text.

ScriptureMemorizer
Responsibility: Manages word removal logic and tracks memorization progress.
Private Attributes:

* _scripture : Scripture
* _scriptureTextList : List<string>
* _totalWordsRemoved : int
  Public Methods:
* ScriptureMemorizer(Scripture scripture)
* removeWordsFromText() : void
* toString() : string
* hasWordsLeft() : bool
  Private Methods:
* convertTextToList() : void

Behavior Description

When a ScriptureMemorizer object is created, it converts the scripture text into a list of individual words using the convertTextToList() method.

The removeWordsFromText() method randomly selects three visible words and replaces them with underscores. Words that are already hidden are skipped. The method tracks the total number of words removed to prevent errors when only a few words remain.

The hasWordsLeft() method checks the list to determine whether any words remain visible. If all words are hidden, the method returns false.

The toString() method joins the word list back into a single string for display.

Program Flow

1. The Program class creates a Reference object.
2. A Scripture object is created using the Reference and scripture text.
3. A ScriptureMemorizer object is created using the Scripture.
4. The program enters a loop that continues while the user has not typed "quit" and words remain visible.
5. The console is cleared.
6. The reference and current scripture state are displayed.
7. The user presses Enter or types "quit".
8. If not quitting, removeWordsFromText() is called to hide additional words.
9. When the loop ends, the final scripture state is displayed and the program prints “Good job!”.

Encapsulation

Encapsulation is demonstrated by keeping all data fields private and exposing functionality through public methods. The Program class does not directly modify the word list. Instead, it interacts with the ScriptureMemorizer class through its public methods. Each class has a clear and specific responsibility, which improves organization, readability, and maintainability.

Conclusion

This design separates responsibilities across four classes and protects internal data using private attributes. The structure follows object-oriented design principles and demonstrates encapsulation by controlling access to data and behavior through well-defined methods.
